This is currently a bit of an unfinished project. The massive data requirements to do what I really want to do require an effort and likely monetary costs that I don't have currently. Hopefully, at some future point, I will be able to get the data that I want and have the time to really think about contructing the best model for this analysis. For now, regressions run in excel provide some good insights.
